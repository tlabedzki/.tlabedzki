#### What am I developing in?
I'm currently intensively expanding my knowledge in the field of Data Science, focusing on Machine Learning and the application of artificial intelligence models in business. I'm pursuing postgraduate studies in `Data Science - advanced data analysis`, which primarily emphasize machine learning using Python, mathematics, and statistics.

In 2025, I will gradually develop my Data Science portfolio here.

#### What am I passionate about?
For many years, I have been passionate about data analysis, and it is undoubtedly one of my greatest interests. In my free time, I create minimalist landscape photography during trips to some of the most beautiful places on our planet.
